                    Except in the case of live-in landlords seeking a lodger, if you are a user who wants to post an ad for a room and/or property to rent in Scotland, then notwithstanding the fact that you may be permitted by law to advertise or rent a room and/or property in Scotland without the following, for the purposes of advertising a room and/or property to rent in Scotland on this Platform, you must either:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            have a valid and active registration in the Scottish Landlords Register; or
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            have a valid application and have paid the relevant fee for registration to the Scottish Landlords Register and not previously had:
                            <ol>
                                <li>a Scottish Landlord Registration revoked and/or been removed from the Scottish Landlords Register; or</li>
                                <li>an application to the Scottish Landlords Register refused.</li>

                    We reserve the right to request evidence from you of the above and/or seek confirmation from the relevant local authority at any time. We also reserve the right to temporarily suspend an account whilst we obtain such evidence and/or confirmation.

            <h3>Posting and responding to ads on the Platform</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>All ads posted to the Platform must be for residential lets only and must be compliant with all appropriate legislation.</li>
                
                <li>You need to register an account with us in order to create and post an ad (also known as a &quot;listing&quot;) on the Platform. When you register for a free account on the Platform, this enables you to post a single ad/listing for rooms and/or properties to rent on the Platform at any one time. You can upgrade your account in order to be able to post additional ads/listings for rooms and/or properties available to rent at the same time. The number of ads/listings for rooms and/or properties available to rent that you can post at any one time on the Platform attracts a &quot;listing allowance&quot;, which is the number of times you can take an action to post a new ad/listing or reactivate an expired ad/listing in a rolling 28-day period. The listing allowance applicable to you is calculated by taking the number of ads/listings you are able to post at any one time on the Platform and multiplying it by 3. For example, with the free account you are able to post a single ad/listing which gives you a listing allowance of 3. In other words, within a rolling 28-day period you could replace your ad/listing with a new ad/listing, or reactivate your ad/listing if it expires, 3 times. If you
                upgraded your account to enable you to post 5 ads/listings at the same time then you would have a listing allowance of 15 that would mean you could replace your ads/listings with new ads/listings or reactivate your ads/listings if they expire, 15 times. You can use your listing allowance across all of your ads/listings as you please, for example, you can use all of your allowance against a single ad/listing or shared between 2, 3 or all of your ads/listings. Any actions other than posting a new ad/listing or reactivating an expired ad/listing, for example editing a live ad/listing, will not affect your listing allowance. For additional information on the listing allowance, please refer to the <a href="../../infowebsitehelp/faq/index.html">FAQ section</a>.</li>
                <li>There are two types of ad that can be posted on the Platform. The first is an ad that can be posted by any normal non-paying member who has registered an account with us (a <strong>&quot;Free Ad&quot;</strong>). The second type of ad, <strong>"Bold Ads"</strong>, can only be posted by members who have paid to upgrade their account. Bold Ads appear highlighted in blue on the search results pages and feature above Free Ads of the same age. For more on the benefits of Bold Ads please refer to the <a href="../../infowebsitehelp/faq/index.html">FAQ section</a>. </li>

                To post an ad on the Platform click on the "Post ad" link on the homepage and follow the instructions. By posting an ad on the Platform you are representing and warranting (which is a legal promise) to us that:
                    <ol>
                        <li>all the information you include in your ad will be truthful and, to the best of your knowledge and belief, accurate and not in any way misleading;</li>
                        <li>any photos or videos you include in your ad will be current and accurate representations of the room(s) and/or properties you are advertising;</li>
                        <li>you have all necessary rights and permissions to advertise and/or rent or let the applicable room or property (note we reserve the right to request proof of such rights and/or permissions); and</li>
                        <li>all ads will comply with these Terms, including clause 7.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                You may not:
                <ol>
                    <li>post multiple ads for the same room and/or property; </li>
                    <li> post dummy or fake ads for rooms and/or properties that aren’t available for let or aren't available to be viewed; </li>
                    <li> delete an ad and repost it in order to make it appear as &quot;New Today&quot;; or</li>
                    
                    <li>in any rolling 28-day period, replace your ad/listing with a new ad/listing, or reactivate your ad/listing if it expires, once you have used up your listing allowance in that 28-day period (as explained in clause 4.2).</li>
                    
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>You are responsible for the content of any ads you post to the Platform, including any errors, omissions or inaccuracies contained in such ads. We accept no liability to you or any other person for the content of any ads posted on our Platform. We advise that you check the content of your ad immediately after posting it to the Platform to ensure you are happy with it. You may edit or remove any ads you have posted on the Platform at any time by logging into your account and clicking on the My Ads link. For more details on how to do this please refer to the <a href="../../infowebsitehelp/faq/index.html">FAQ section</a>.</li>
                <li>Once a Free Ad has been posted on the Platform, only users who have paid to upgrade their account to get &quot;Early Bird Access&quot; will be able to respond to that ad for the first 7 days, commencing on the day it was first posted. After an ad has been on the Platform for 7 days or more any registered user of the Platform may respond to that ad via the Platform. Bold Ads can be contacted by all registered users immediately.</li>
                <li>You agree to only contact advertisers by means of the official "contact advertiser" options available on each ad. For your own security, you must not use any contact details contained within the body of an ad itself or hidden within images.</li>
                <li>You may contact other members of the Platform via our on-site messaging system. <strong>However, please be advised we will not reveal any of our members' contact details or other personal information without the relevant members' permission.</strong> We do not routinely monitor all communications between Users via our on-site messaging system, but we may use software to track communications and we reserve the right to monitor them in order to investigate any suspected breach of our terms and conditions, any illegal behaviour or any other misuse of our service, or for any other reasonable reason as determined by us from time to time. We reserve the right, in our discretion, to archive or discard communications sent via the messaging system on our Platform after a minimum of fifty six (56) days or otherwise immediately if we feel that the message is unlawful or inappropriate.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to refuse to list or deactivate any ads or edit any User Generated Content we deem, in our reasonable discretion, to be in violation of these Terms or which we are instructed to refuse to list or deactivate by any court or law enforcement or regulatory authority. In such cases no refunds will be given. We reserve the right to request proof of your right to post ads and/or other User Generated Content. In the event we: (a) receive any complaints about an ad or advertiser; (b) receive notice of an investigation into an ad or advertiser by any law enforcement or regulatory authority; or (c) otherwise become aware of any violation of these Terms or any illegal behaviour conducted by an advertiser, we reserve the right to temporarily suspend or deactivate (with or without notice) any ad or account in question while we investigate the matter.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to publish any ads you post to the Platform across the SpareRoom network of sites, as well as uploading any ads that are posted to the Platform to other relevant portal websites from time to time, such as other third-party property search websites. <strong>We will never post users’ contact details with their ads on third-party websites.</strong></li>
                <li>We allow all users the ability to Renew their ads. Renewing reposts the ad back into the listings as New, and posts your ad at the top of the New listings. Renewing won't post your ad back as New Today. The search results your Renewed ad appears on, and its position on that page, is determined by the number of newer, or more recently Boosted and/or Renewed ads that have been posted. For a full explanation of how ads are ranked on SpareRoom please refer to our <a href="../../infowebsitehelp/faq/index.html#howarethespareroomlistingsordered">FAQ section</a>. Renewing an ad restarts the 7 day Early Bird phase.
                </li>
                <li>All ads on the Platform contain a public profile of the advertiser. By posting an ad you consent to information such as your age and gender being included in your profile. To update any of the information shown on your profile, please contact the Customer Services team at <a class="email" href="../../../contact.html">customerservices@<span class="hidden">null</span>spareroom.co.uk</a></li>

            <h3>Upgrading your account</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>You may upgrade your account at any time by clicking on the &quot;Upgrade&quot; link in the &quot;My account&quot; section of our Platform. Where any upgrade includes an increase in the number of ads/listings you can post at any one time, your listing allowance (as explained in clause 4.2) will increase accordingly (taking into account any part of the allowance already used in the current rolling 28-day period).</li>
                <li>Where a four week upgrade of your account is purchased, you can during that four week upgrade period (via the &quot;My account&quot;, &quot;My Ads&quot; or &quot;Upgrade&quot; section of our Platform) pause that upgrade once for a maximum of twelve months.  When you confirm the upgrade is to be paused, you will be provided with a unique code and instructions on how to reactivate your upgrade again.  When you reactivate your upgrade, it will continue to run for the remaining period of your upgrade.  For example, if you purchase a four week upgrade on 1 January and pause it on 14 January, you have twelve months to reactivate your upgrade and, once reactivated, the upgrade will run for the remaining fourteen days (even if reactivated on the last day of the twelve month reactivation period).  If you fail to reactivate your upgrade within the twelve month reactivation period then the remaining period of your upgrade will be lost.  For more details of the different upgrade options available, and payment options on offer, please refer to the Upgrade section of our Platform.</li>
                <li>When you choose to upgrade your account we will charge you a payment for the upgrade period you have chosen. Payments will be processed by our third party payment processor, currently Stripe or Worldpay, using their secure server or can be made using Paypal or any other payment method as advertised on the Platform from time to time.</li>
                <li>Your account will automatically revert to our free service at the end of your upgrade period unless you opt to extend your upgrade period by making a further payment. When any upgrade which included an increase in the number of ads/listings you could post at any one time expires and your account reverts to our free service or a lower number of ads/listings you can post at any one time, your listing allowance (as explained in clause 4.2) will be adjusted to reflect the reduction in the number of ads/listings. We will only charge you for the period you have selected to upgrade for. By giving us your payment card details you are not granting us any continuing authority to automatically extend your upgrade period unless you have specifically opted to make regular, ongoing payments as part of a monthly subscription package, including any activated auto top-up of funds for our Featured Ads service (as explained in clause 6.1 (a)).</li>
                <li>All monthly subscription packages are deemed continuous from the date of purchase.</li>
                <li>Once you've confirmed the payment to upgrade your account and we have sent you a confirmation email confirming your purchase, a contract for upgraded services between you and us will have been formed. Your confirmation of payment will be taken as your express request for us to begin supplying the relevant services immediately following our sending of the confirmation email. You have the right to cancel your contract for upgraded services for up to 14 days after the contract has been formed under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges Regulations) 2013 (the <strong>"Regulations"</strong>). To exercise your right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision. You may do this by contacting us via email, telephone or post, by completing the cancellation form which can be found on the Platform.When any upgrade which included an increase in the number of ads/listings you could post at any one time is cancelled and your account reverts to our free service or an alternative upgrade which includes a lower number of ads/listings you can post at any one time, your listing allowance (as explained in clause 4.2) will be adjusted to reflect the reduction in the number of ads/listings. Please note that in accordance with the Regulations, once you have started to receive the benefits of our upgraded service you will not be entitled to a full refund and we are entitled to charge you a pro rata amount for any services you have already received. The amount you are refunded will depend on when you decide to cancel your contract and will be calculated as follows:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>if you cancel your purchase within the first 7 days of your contract with us and while your upgrade is still active, you will be charged a pro rata amount for each day or part of a day of your subscription period that you have used. In the event the upgrade has already expired before contacting us to cancel, the upgrade will no longer be eligible for a refund of any kind.</li>
                        <li>the pro rata amount you will be charged will be based on the full price for a 7 day upgrade, i.e. 1/7th of the price of a 7 day upgrade will be deducted from the total amount you have paid for each day or part of a day that you have used and you will be refunded the remainder of your payment;</li>
                        <li>for the purposes of calculating the amount to be refunded, a 'day' means a complete 24 hour period starting from the time that we send you confirmation of your upgrade purchase;</li>
                        <li>for the avoidance of doubt, any cancellation requests received in the first 24 hours of your contract will incur 1 days' charge; requests received after 24 hours but before 48 hours have passed will incur 2 days' charge and so on; and</li>
                        <li>if you cancel your purchase after 7 days but before the end of the 14 day cancellation period, we will charge you the full cost of purchasing a 7 day subscription period but will refund you the remainder of your payment.</li>
                        <li>If you make use of any additional services provided to you as part of your purchase, a pro rata amount for these services will also be charged.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Any cancellations to a monthly subscription package will be effective from your next payment date. This doesn’t affect your right to cancel under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges Regulations) 2013 (the <strong>"Regulations"</strong>) as outlined in clause 5.6. When any monthly subscription package which included an increase in the number of ads/listings you could post at any one time is cancelled and your account reverts our free service or an alternative upgrade which includes a lower number of ads/listings you can post at any one time, your listing allowance (as explained in clause 4.2) will be adjusted to reflect the reduction in the number of ads/listings.</li>
                <li>We may, at our discretion, provide users amending their monthly subscription package a pro rata refund based on any remaining services not used during the active monthly subscription period. The amount due will be calculated on the time remaining before the next payment date and any Boosts which have been used during that time. If all allocated Boosts have been used during the active monthly period, you won’t be eligible for a pro rata refund whilst amending your subscription. This doesn’t affect your right to cancel under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges Regulations) 2013 (the <strong>"Regulations"</strong>) as outlined in clause 5.6</li>
                <li>For the purposes of calculating a pro-rata refund, the number of Boosts used will be assigned a monetary value up to and including the value of your full monthly payment should all Boosts have been used prior to us receiving your request for cancellation. If there are Boosts remaining, an amount based on the number used will be deducted from the overall refund due. For example:
                <style>#boost_table{margin:10px 0 20px}#boost_table td,#boost_table th{border:solid 1px grey;padding:4px;}</style>
                    <table id="boost_table">
                    <tr><th>Number of Boosts used</th><th>Cost to be deducted</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>1 boost used	</td><td>&pound;39 to be deducted</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>2 boosts used</td><td>&pound;44 to be deducted</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>3 boosts used</td><td>&pound;49 to be deducted</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>4 boosts used</td><td>&pound;59 to be deducted</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>5 boosts used</td><td>&pound;69 to be deducted</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>6 boosts used</td><td>&pound;79 to be deducted</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>7 boosts used</td><td>&pound;89 to be deducted </td></tr>
                </table>
                If more than 7 Boosts are made available to you as part of a higher listing subscription package, the amount deducted will rise in increments for every Boost up to and including the value of your full monthly payment should all Boosts have been used. </li>
                <li>Annual packages cannot be cancelled or downgraded. However, at our discretion, we may allow a user to cancel an annual package to increase their overall number of listings by opting for an alternative professional upgrade package. In these cases, a pro rata refund will be calculated on the remaining time based on the nearest month’s usage. The refund amount for the existing month will be calculated on the volume of Boosts used in that month. For the avoidance of doubt, the month period will run from the date of purchase. The new higher listing upgrade package must be purchased at the time of cancellation. This doesn’t affect your right to cancel under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges Regulations) 2013 (the <strong>"Regulations"</strong>) as outlined in clause 5.6</li>
                <li>Refunds will be made via your original method of payment and will usually be processed within 7 working days.</li>
                <li>Please note that you will no longer have the right to cancel your upgraded subscription after your contract for upgraded subscription has been fully performed which in the case of a contract for a 7 day subscription period will be after the expiry of the 7 day period.</li>

            <h3>Additional features for room and/or property advertisers</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>This clause of these Terms only applies to members of the Platform who are advertising rooms and/or properties. Any members of the Platform advertising rooms and/or properties that have registered an account with us, and are paying for an upgraded subscription service, may also elect to take advantage of some of the additional features and services we offer to those advertising rooms and/or properties as described in this clause of these Terms.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Featured Ads
                            <ol>
                                <li>We operate a pay per click system, which you can use to give your ads greater prominence in search listings. Search listings will generally be displayed by relevance to a user’s search query. However, we also permit members of the Platform advertising rooms and/or properties to set their own pay per click fees  to promote their ads (the <strong>&quot;PPC Rate&quot;</strong>). Ads that are subject to such pay per click arrangements will receive greater prominence than normal ads. Ads that have the highest PPC Rate set for the relevant search terms will be given the greatest prominence in the search listings on a declining scale.</li>
                                
                                    <li>
                                        Once selected, in order for the Featured Ads service to be active, it is necessary for your account to have a positive funds balance. If your account has a positive funds balance but that balance is insufficient to cover your PPC Rate, the Featured Ads service will still be active, but any click on your ad will still apply your chosen PPC Rate and your account will go into a negative balance. If there are no funds available within your account, including any negative balance, then the Featured Ads service will be automatically deactivated, and your ads will return to being normal ads.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Funds for the Featured Ads service (minimum of £10) can be added manually to your account at any time through our third party payment processor, currently Stripe, using their secure server, or made using PayPal or any other payment method as advertised on the Platform from time to time.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        In addition, we offer an auto top-up feature on the iOS App and the website (www.spareroom.co.uk) whereby, when the funds in your account reach £0 or you have a negative balance (as described in (ii) above), they are automatically topped-up, utilising your chosen debit or credit card, by the amount you pre-selected (either when you set the feature up or subsequently). The auto top-up feature is not available on the Android App or for use with PayPal.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The minimum amount that can be selected for the auto top-up feature is £10 and the maximum amount that can be selected for the auto top-up feature is £1,000. Spending on the Featured Ads service will continue to be governed by the daily spend limit set by you.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Where your account has a negative balance (as explained in (ii) above), any funds added manually or through the auto top-up feature will first clear the negative balance, with any remaining balance being credited to your account.  For example, where £10 is added to an account which has a negative balance of 5p, the account balance will show as £9.95.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The auto top-up feature can be cancelled at any time through the Platform by accessing &quot;payments&quot; in the Featured Ads section of &quot;My Account&quot; and following the instructions.
                                    </li>

                            Boosts
                            <ol>
                                <li>Boosts can be applied to new ads or reactivated ads after a period of 7 days and are used to push your ads back up to the very top of the listings. Once applied, the ad remains Boosted for 24 hours. The search results page your Boosted ad appears on, and its position on that page, is determined by the number of New Today and/or Boosted ads posted to SpareRoom after your Boost was applied. For a full explanation of how ads are ranked on SpareRoom please refer to the <a href="../../infowebsitehelp/faq/index.html#howarethespareroomlistingsordered">FAQ section</a>.</li>
                                <li>Boosts can be used on the same ad or applied to different ads, but only one Boost can be used on the same ad within a 7 day period. Once a Boost has been successfully applied to an ad it can&#39;t be paused or applied to another ad and that ad can't also be Renewed for a period of 24 hours. For an overview of our Renew feature please refer to clause 4.12</li>
                                <li>Certain subscription packages (as identified on our Platform) automatically include a number of Boosts. In these circumstances, the number of Boosts applied to your account is calculated as 50% of the monthly listings your package contains, rounded down to the nearest whole number. For example, a user with 10 listings gets 5 boosts per month, a user with 5 listings gets 2. The number of Boosts included in your subscription package and available to use resets each month on your subscription payment date. Unused Boosts which are automatically included in your subscription package can’t be carried over or saved.</li>
                                <li>If you have an upgrade or subscription package which does not automatically include Boosts or you want additional Boosts to those already automatically included in your subscription package then these can be purchased through the &quot;My ads&quot; section of our Platform or via the link on your ad panel. Boosts purchased in accordance with this clause 6.1 (b) (iv): (i) are valid for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase (and expiry dates for these Boosts can be found in the &quot;My ads&quot; section of our Platform); and (ii) can be used after the expiry or termination of your upgrade or subscription package up to the Boost expiry date. Any Boosts not used within 12 months of purchase will expire and no longer be available for use.</li>
                                <li>For more information on Boosts and how they work, please contact customer services on <a href="tel:+441617681162"> 0161 768 1162</a>.</li>
