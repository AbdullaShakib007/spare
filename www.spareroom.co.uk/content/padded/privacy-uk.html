			<h3>Third party content, websites and contributors</h3>
			<ol>
			 	<li>Our website may contain content and links to other websites and microsites that are operated by third parties. In addition, advertisements contained on our website may operate as links to that advertiser’s website, and such advertisers and third parties may also use and place cookies on your computer.</li>
			 	<li>We do not control, and accept no liability or responsibility for, these third party websites, advertisements and cookies. This privacy policy does not apply to such third party websites, microsites, advertisements and cookies. Any information such third parties collect by virtue of you clicking on a third party link on our website will be collected and used in accordance with the privacy policy of that third party.

		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Security and data retention</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>We employ appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect against any unauthorised access to or unlawful processing of any personal information about you that we hold. We will retain your information for a period as defined in our data retention policy or as long as the law requires or permits.</li>
				<li>Data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure. Although we employ appropriate technological and organisational security measures to protect your data we cannot guarantee the security of any data sent over the internet.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>International data transfers</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>We collect data from wherever users are situated. The information we collect will be transferred to the UK from any other country in which you may be located, and will as such be subject to General Data Protection Regulation rather than the laws of the country in which you are resident.</li>
				<li>We do not transfer personal data collected via our website outside the European Economic Area (unless you have consented; it is necessary to provide the services you have requested; or it is otherwise required or permitted by law).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Your rights</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>You are entitled to know what personal data we hold about you and you may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure it is accurate and kept up to date or to request deletion in accordance with this section 11. If you wish to do this, please contact us using the contact information provided in section 1 above. There will be no charge for this service; if, however, you log multiple requests, a nominal charge may be applied to cover the administration of those requests. We may also require you to provide us with appropriate identification.</li>
				<li>
					Under the GDPR, you have the right to ‘block’ or request the deletion or removal of personal data to prevent further processing. This right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. Specific circumstances in which you can request the deletion or removal of personal data include:
					<ol>
						<li>Where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed</li>
						<li>Where you withdraw consent</li>
						<li>When you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing</li>
						<li>Where the personal data was unlawfully processed (i.e. otherwise in breach of the GDPR)</li>
						<li>Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Save where your account has been closed for a breach, personal data associated with any account on our site will be retained for a maximum period of 12 months following an account closure. We reserve the right to access this data during this period for the purposes of fraud prevention and/or to investigate any complaints we may receive.</p>

					<p>In cases where a deletion is not possible due to legal, statutory or contractual retention periods, or if it requires disproportionate efforts or prejudices your legitimate interests, the data will be blocked instead of deleted.</p>
				</li>
				<li>You may also request from us a copy of any of your personal data that has been processed through automated means. This will be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (where technically feasible), which you may then transmit to another controller. You have the right to request that we send this data to another controller on your behalf, but only if it is technically feasible to do so.</li>
				<li>You have the right to withdraw your consent for us to collect, process and store your data at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please confirm this via email to <a class="email" href="mailto:DPO@spareroom.co.uk">DPO@<span class="hidden">null</span>spareroom.co.uk</a></li>
				<li>If you have a complaint about any aspect of data protection or if you feel your privacy has been breached by us, we would like to hear from you. To help us investigate and resolve your concerns as quickly as possible, please contact us via email to <a class="email" href="mailto:DPO@spareroom.co.uk">DPO@<span class="hidden">null</span>spareroom.co.uk</a></li>
				<li>You may request that we cease sending you any marketing information at any time by notifying us in writing, following any &quot;unsubscribe&quot; instructions included in any marketing communications which we send to you, or by clicking on &quot;My Account&quot; on the website homepage and updating your account preferences.</li>
				<li>If you are unhappy with the final response you have received from us, you have the right to complain to the supervisory authority: the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). You can call the ICO on 030 3123 1113 or visit the ICO website: <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ico.org.uk</a>.</li>
				<li>You are required to provide personal data in order to enter into a contract with us. Failure to provide this personal data may mean that we are unable to execute the contract, and could result in termination of our provision of services to you.</li>
				<li>If at any time we intend to process your personal data for a reason or in a manner not originally communicated, then prior to performing that processing we will provide you with all relevant information, in accordance with section 11.2 above.</li>
